# react-native-example

This repo shows a working example of our Basis Theory elements running on React Native via the React Native bridge. To get started run `yarn start`
and follow the prompts to run on iOS or Android.

:warning: While this example works fine, the new 
[React Native SDK](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/sdks/mobile/react-native/) is recommended as
it makes it easier since you don't need to deal with Kotlin or Swift code.
